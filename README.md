# JPACRUDProject

## Overview
This is a CRUD application designed to show fast food options for the Mediterranen diet. Users of the application will be able to read restaurant information, create new restaurants, and add and delete menu items, calorie information and entree prices from a database for display on a website.

To use the application, users can search for a restaurant by ID, or click on a table of links that take them directly to a restaurant's page. The restaurant's page shows meal, price and calorie information, and contains options to update and delete the restaurant record.

## Lessons Learned
- Website design can be tough. I ended up trying out a few ideas with CSS for the website, and scrapped them all in order to come up with a more cohesive design. The final end project will have an omnipresent navigation bar with the option to add a restaurant.
- Another issue for website design is picture and icon display. One idea for the final end project is to incorporate the business logos of each of the fast food restaurants in a table; the user will be able to click on the logo of the business and see the menu items, calorie, and price information of the different entrees. Additionally, users should be able to upload pictures of the meals they are adding.
- There are a lot of tricky issues in the interplay of the DAO, JSPs, controller, and database, mostly in ensuring that links lead the user to the correct pages and operations do what they are supposed to. I focused mainly on getting the application to work properly, but after that was accomplished and I began working on the site's layout, it was clear how front end design can be a career all to itself. I looked at popular websites on the internet for design ideas and was overwhelmed with the amount of detail necessary to create a professional navigation bar, for instance.
